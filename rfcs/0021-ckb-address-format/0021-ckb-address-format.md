# CKB Address Format

## Abstract

*CKB Address Format* is an application level cell **lock script** display recommendation. The lock script consists of three key parameters, including *code_hash*, *hash_type* and *args*. CKB address packages lock script into a single line, verifiable, and human read friendly format.

## Data Structure

### Payload Format Types

To generate a CKB address, we firstly encode lock script to bytes array, name *payload*. And secondly, we wrap the payload into final address format.

There are several methods to convert lock script into payload bytes array. We use 1 byte to identify the payload format.

| format type |                   description                  |
|:-----------:|------------------------------------------------|
|  0x01       | short version for locks with popular code_hash |
|  0x02       | full version with hash_type = "Data"           |
|  0x04       | full version with hash_type = "Type"           |

### Short Payload Format

Short payload format is a compact format which identifies common used code_hash by 1 byte code_hash_index instead of 32 bytes code_hash.

```c
payload = 0x01 | code_hash_index | single_arg
```

To translate payload to lock script, one can convert code_hash_index to code_hash and hash_type with the following *popular code_hash table*. And single_arg as the args.


| code_hash_index |        code_hash     |   hash_type  |      args     |
|:---------------:|----------------------|:------------:|---------------|
|      0x00       | SECP256K1 + blake160 |     Type     |  blake160(PK) |
|      0x01       | SECP256K1 + hash160  |     Type     |  hash160(PK)  |

\* The blake160 here means the leading 20 bytes truncation of Blake2b hash result.
\* The hash160 here means Bitcoin address calculation *double hash* algorithm, which means `hash160(PK) := Ripemd160(SHA256(PK))`.

### Full Payload Format

Full payload format directly encodes all data field of lock script.

```c
payload = 0x02/0x04 | code_hash | len(arg[0]) | arg[0] | ...
```

The first byte identifies the lock script's hash_type, 0x02 for "Data", 0x04 for "Type". We convert every element of args to plain bytes array format, and add a length number in front of every array. To keep it simple, we limit every argument size to maxium 256, which is 1 byte.

## Wrap to Address

We follow [Bitcoin base32 address format (BIP-173)][bip173] rules to wraps payload in to address, which uses Bech32 encoding and a [BCH checksum][bch].

The original version of Bech32 allows at most 90 characters long. Similar with [BOLT][BOLT_url], we simply remove the length limit. The error correction function is disabled when the Bech32 string is longer than 90. We don't intent to use this function anyway, because there is a risk to get wrong correction result.

A Bech32 string consists of the **human-readable part**, the **separator**, and the **data part**. The last 6 characters of data part is checksum. The data part is base32 encoded. Here is the readable translation of base32 encoding table.

|       |0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|-------|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|-|
|**+0** |q|p|z|r|y|9|x|8|
|**+8** |g|f|2|t|v|d|w|0|
|**+16**|s|3|j|n|5|4|k|h|
|**+24**|c|e|6|m|u|a|7|l|

The human-readable part is "**ckb**" for CKB mainnet, and "**ckt**" for the testnet. The separator is always "1".

## Examples and Demo Code

```py
    # for short payload format
    pk = "13e41d6F9292555916f17B4882a5477C01270142"
    address = "ckb1qyqp8eqad7ffy42ezmchkjyz54rhcqf8q9pqrn323p"

    # for full payload format
    code_hash = "48a2ce278d84e1102b67d01ac8a23b31a81cc54e922e3db3ec94d2ec4356c67c"
    hash_type = "Data"
    args = ['dde7801c073dfb3464c7b1f05b806bb2bbb84e99', '00c1ddf9c135061b7635ca51e735fc2b03cee339']
    address = "ckb1qfy29n383kzwzyptvlgp4j9z8vc6s8x9f6fzu0dnaj2d9mzr2mr8c9xau7qpcpealv6xf3a37pdcq6ajhwuyaxg5qrqam7wpx5rpka34efg7wd0u9vpuaceeu5fsh5"
